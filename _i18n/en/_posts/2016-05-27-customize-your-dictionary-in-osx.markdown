During the process of learning some new knowledge, we will come across lots of new words. However, there are multiple things share a same word. Like ISP, it means Internet Service Provider in Network but means Image signal processor in image processing. It's annoying to try to find its meaning when you forget this words. Another condition is that I will feel much more sense of achievement if I can trance what I have learnt. For example, when I learning French words, there are too many words to memorize and it makes the learning process endless. What if I can put the new words into the my custom-built dictionary? Every time you finish your todays work you can add new words you have learnt into your dictionary (like your memory).

For this two reasons, I think maybe I can try finding a way to customize a dictionary for myself. Since the major of work is adding words to dictionary, I do not need to rewrite an app from nothing. And make it simple and neat, I decide to use Dictionary.app of OSX, which is the application I also use very often.
