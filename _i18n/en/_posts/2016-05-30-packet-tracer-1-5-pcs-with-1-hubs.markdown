With a hub you can connect multiple PCs.

The setup process is simple, you do not need to make any configuration to hub.

The only things you need to do is connecting hub to PCs and give PCs its address and subnet mask.

Here are my configuration:

PC1: 10.0.0.1/8

PC2: 10.0.0.2/8

PC3: 10.0.0.3/8

PC4: 10.0.0.4/8

PC5: 10.0.0.5/8

And the topography is showed below:

Done! You can try to ping the PCs among each other now.
